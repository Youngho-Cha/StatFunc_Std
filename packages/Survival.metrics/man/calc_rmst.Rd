\details{
\strong{Fundamentals of Survival Data:}
Survival analysis, also known as time-to-event analysis, deals with data
where the outcome of interest is the time until an event occurs. This data
has two key components:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Time:} The duration from a starting point to the event or the end of observation.
\item \strong{Event Status:} A binary indicator of whether the event of interest occurred (e.g., 1 = event occurred, 0 = no event).
}
A crucial feature of survival data is \strong{censoring}. An observation is
censored when we have partial information about its event time. For example,
a study might end before a subject experiences the event. These censored
observations are not discarded; they are used in the analysis up to the time
they were last observed, which is a key strength of survival analysis methods.

\section{Statistical Method}{

\describe{
\item{\strong{Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST):}}{
The RMST is a robust measure for summarizing and comparing survival curves.
It represents the average event-free survival time of a group up to a
pre-specified time point, \eqn{\tau} (tau).

Conceptually, the RMST is the \strong{area under the Kaplan-Meier survival curve}
from time 0 up to \eqn{\tau}.

\strong{When to Use RMST:}
The RMST offers a clinically intuitive interpretation (e.g., "the average
patient in the treatment group lived X months longer than in the control
group over a 5-year period"). It is an excellent alternative to the Hazard
Ratio (HR) from Cox regression, particularly in cases where the
\strong{Proportional Hazards (PH) assumption is not met} (e.g., when survival
curves cross). Unlike the HR, the RMST does not assume that the treatment
effect is constant over time.
}

\item{\strong{RMST Calculation:}}{
The RMST is calculated by integrating the Kaplan-Meier survival function,
S(t), from time 0 to the chosen time horizon \eqn{\tau}.
\deqn{RMST = \int_{0}^{\tau} S(t) dt}
Where:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{S(t)} is the Kaplan-Meier survival probability at time t.
\item \eqn{\tau} is the pre-specified time point, often chosen based on
the maximum follow-up time of the study or a clinically meaningful
endpoint.
}
The primary use of RMST in clinical trials is often to compare two groups
by calculating the \strong{difference in RMST}, which provides a direct measure
of the average survival time gained or lost due to the treatment or exposure.
