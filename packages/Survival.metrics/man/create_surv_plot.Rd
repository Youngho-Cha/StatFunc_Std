\details{
\strong{Fundamentals of Survival Data:}
Survival analysis, also known as time-to-event analysis, deals with data
where the outcome of interest is the time until an event occurs. This data
has two key components:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Time:} The duration from a starting point to the event or the end of observation.
\item \strong{Event Status:} A binary indicator of whether the event of interest occurred (e.g., 1 = event occurred, 0 = no event).
}
A crucial feature of survival data is \strong{censoring}. An observation is
censored when we have partial information about its event time. For example,
a study might end before a subject experiences the event, or a subject might
withdraw. These censored observations are not discarded; they are used in the
analysis up to the time they were last observed, which is a key strength of
survival analysis methods.

\section{Statistical Method}{

\describe{
\item{\strong{Kaplan-Meier (K-M) Method:}}{
The Kaplan-Meier estimator is a non-parametric statistic used to estimate
the survival function, S(t), from time-to-event data. Instead of a single
formula, it is an iterative process calculated at each event time. The
survival probability at any given time is the cumulative product of the
conditional probabilities of surviving each preceding time interval.
}

\describe{
\item{\strong{Kaplan-Meier (K-M) Curve Visualization:}}{
The Kaplan-Meier survival curve is the graphical representation of the K-M
estimate of the survival function, S(t). This function visualizes how the
estimated survival probability changes over time.

The curve is plotted as a \strong{step function}, where the y-axis represents the
survival probability and the x-axis represents time. The key features of
the plot are:
\itemize{
\item A horizontal line indicates a period where no events occurred.
\item A vertical drop in the curve occurs at each time an event is observed.
The height of the drop reflects the decrease in survival probability at that moment.
\item Small vertical ticks or crosses on the curve often represent
\strong{censored observations}, showing the time at which those subjects
were last known to be event-free.
}
By visualizing the K-M estimate, one can intuitively compare the survival
experience between different groups, identifying which group has a better
or worse prognosis over the follow-up period.
